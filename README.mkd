Here's the idea, `git ttt`
===========================

A simple issue tracking system built into the standard git workflow with git hooks.
All extra functionality happens with plugins.

*It's a git-backed text-based ticket tracker* - `git ttt`

### Simplest usage
To open a ticket
     git ttt -m"This is something we need to do" --type=work --release=0.1 --points=5
     git ttt -m"Here's the description of another tictet" -t work -r 0.1 -p 5

To contribute to a ticket
     git commit -m"Getting closer to solving the first thing [:1]"

To view a ticket's current info
    git ttt :1

To update a ticket
     git ttt :1 -r 0.2

To create a sub (or referencing) ticket
     git ttt -m"One more ticket" --sub=1 -t work -r 0.1 -p 5
     git ttt :3 -s2      # Now this is a sub-ticket for ticket #2

To close a ticket
     git commit -m"Fixed the first thing [closed :1]"
     git commit -m"Fixed the other thing [closed :2 :3]"

To see an overview of your tickets
     git ttt st
     git ttt status

To see an overview of all your releases
     git ttt st -r

To see ALL tickets
     git ttt st -a

To search for tickets
     git ttt 'release-0.[1-2]'                    # Find any ticket that has anything matching the regular expression string
     git ttt 'release-0.[1-2]' -c                 # Same as above but also include all commit messages associated with tickets
     git ttt '[?x :where [?x :owner "paul"]]'     # or maybe Python list-comp style? [x if x.owner=="paul"]
     git ttt '[?x :owner "paul"]'                 # x.owner=="paul"
     git ttt '[?x :point #"[0-2]H"]'              # High impact tickets with 0-2 effort - x.point==r"[0-2]H"


### Notes:
 * When a release's tickets are all closed, a tag is created.  This can be toggled off in the configuration file.
 * Types are configurable in a file, along with the default type
 * Point scales are configurable in a file, along with the default
 * Point scales can be any list.  For example Fibonacci effort and project impact together `[0L 0M 0H 1L 1M ... 8L 8M 8H]`
 * Points internally are captured as unicode strings
 * Ticket states are configurable in a file
 * The config file is in the repo, in EDN format`.ttt/tttrc`
 * Tickets with contributed work are toggled "in-process" (or whatever state follows open)
 * Tickets can be moved into new states using commit messages: `Example commit message [custom-state :5]`
 * Tickets can have commits/work attributed to them, just listing them in the commit message: `Example commit message [:6 :7]`
 * Tickets do not have to belong to a release
 * Tickets that reference a release will result in an error being thrown
 * Tickets are owned by the last person who touches them (unless a pluging changes that behavior)
 * Everything in the data structure is timestamped with Unix Time // UTC
 * Releases are in the data structure (an EDN file, `.ttt/data.edn`)
 * Releases are created with tickets via the `--release*=` or `-RR` option
 * Releases can be merged or made into "subprojects" if their `:name` points to another release keyword
 * Releases are deleted by editing the data file directly;  If a ticket is closed and its release is not there, it is ignored.
 * Releases should be treated like epics
 * All other functionality is added by plugins (the base system is built upon the same foundation as plugins)
 * Plugins are stored in `.ttt/plugins/` and toggled in the config file `.ttt/.tttrc`
 * Plugins are free to register new commands/options
 * Install involves referencing the ttt script in your ~/.gitconfig
 * Alternatively, `ttt` script can be copied to a repo and used directly (without the `git ...` prefix)
 * ttt will modify your repo's githooks as needed
 * ttt is initialized with the first use of the `git ttt` command
 * ttt can be removed from a repo with `git ttt destroy`


### The proposed data structure
```clojure
{
    :releases {
        :0.1 {:name "0.1", :created TIMESTAMP, :completed nil}
        :0.1-mistake {:name :0.1 :created TIMESTAMP, :completed nil
    }
    :tickets [
        {:id :3
         :summary "One more ticket"
         :description ""
         :reported-by "email from .gitconfig"
         :owner "email from .gitconfig"
         :closed-by "email from .gitconfig"
         :points "5"
         :type "work"
         :states {:open TIMESTAMP
                  :in-progress TIMESTAMP
                  :closed TIMESTAMP
         }
         :current-state :open
         :history [
             { :commit "git hash"
               :at TIMESTAMP
             },
         ]
         :sub :2
         :branch "branch name of the last in-progress commit"
         :release :0.1
        }
    ]
}
```

### Requirements and installation
ttt needs `node` to be installed.

To install for *ALL* git projects, save the `ttt` file somewhere (preferably on your path) and then:

     git config --global --add alias.root '!pwd -P'
     git config --global --add alias.ttt '!/full/path/to/ttt'

And set your local post-commit git hook to:

     git ttt __core__ process-git `git log -n1 --pretty=format:"%H %ae %s"` 

- - -

To test ttt on a single project, just add the root alias, check the `ttt` file into your repo, and call it directly:

     `./ttt -m"Making a new ticket"`

And set your local post-commit git hook to:

     `git root`/ttt __core__ process-git `git log -n1 --pretty=format:"%H %ae %s"`

Questions
----------
### Wait...  won't there be conflicts all the time?
If you commit early and often, there will rarely be conflicts.  ttt encourages you to do the right thing and helps reinforce best practices.
If a conflict does happen, just `git ttt resolve` - this will reorder the conflicting tickets based on timestamps and update all the ticket numbers.

You're also free to fix conflicts by hand (which just involves renumbering the tickets), submit a patch to make `resolve` better, or write a plugin.

### Why are the tickets in a vector and not in a map?
The logical keys for map-based tickets would be `:1, :2, :3` - but if you're numerically indexing something, you're better off just using a vector.
Internally, tickets know their own position within the list via the `:id` key.

### How does `ttt` handle concurrent ticket updates?
A lock file is used to ensure that only one edit can happen at a time.  When the lock file is present, ttt quits and notifies the user.
If the lock file is mistakenly there, you can just `rm .tttlock`

### Why aren't ticket IDs proper keywords?
There's currently a bug in the ClojureScript reader that prevents it from reading keywords where the leading character is an integer.
To manuver around this, the current choice is to make all IDs integers.  In the future, this may change, but all calling semantics will be the same.


Extending ttt; writing plugins
--------------------------------
### The `__core__` API
Quick notes: The plugins can be written in any language, but need to read in from stdin and push to stdout.

ttt itself is the public API: `ttt __core__ function-name` will return the output of the function
